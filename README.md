### Description

Boys to Men is an afterschool program for teenage boys in the Atlanta, GA area. The program is run by a friend of mine and I wanted to donate a website.

### Technologies

This is a front end heavy project built with React, you could call it an "ERN" stack since there isn't a database connected. The back end simply uses Express so as to deploy correctly. Styling is accomplished with the Styled-Components and React-Bootstrap libraries. This site displays a random verse from the English Standard Version Bible at esv.org, and the axios-react package is used to consume this API.
